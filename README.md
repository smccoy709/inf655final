# Weather Dashboard App
The weather dashboard app will allow a user to select a location from the drop-down list and receive the real-time weather for the location.  If a user selects, for example, New York, New York, they'll receive the real-time weather for the city of New York.  It would also display on the left side of the main container the current day of the week with the date (day, month, year) underneath it, followed by the selected location, an image of the current weather of the selected location, the temperature of the location, and the weather's condition type.  On the right side of the container, it'll have two sections:  top and bottom.  The top part of the right container will include a real-time seven-day forecast for the weather of the selected location, which will update in real-time with the current day being first in the list.  It will display an image of the current weather for that day's forecast, the day of the week, and the temperature.  The bottom right part of the container will display the selected location's UV Index (a numeric value that also states if it is low, medium, or high), the humidity percentage, the wind speed in miles per hour, and the population from the most recent census results.

The real-time weather will update every hour on the hour, and the days of the week will change with the current day and the date reflecting the current date.  The weather dashboard app selects its data by using the OpenWeatherMap API.  The background is an animated GIF of a thunderstorm so it can provide some interactivity for the end-user.  The weather conditions that could be shown for each location, include rain (with an image that has a cloud with raindrops), snow (with an image of a snowflake), clear (with an image of the sun), and cloudy (with an image of half a sun covered by clouds).  The locations to be selected are cities throughout the United States (domestically) and worldwide (internationally).  Each location's weather metrics will reflect that location's real-time weather.  The locations that can be selected are also listed in alphabetical order for ease of navigation and location.
